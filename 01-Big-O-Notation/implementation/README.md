# Big O Notation Implementations

**Navigation:** [🏠 Home](../../README.md) > [📚 Big O Notation](../README.md) > 💻 Implementation

This directory contains practical JavaScript implementations demonstrating various time and space complexities.

## Files

- `complexity-examples.js` - Examples of different time and space complexity classes
- `run-examples.js` - Runner script to visualize and measure algorithm performance
- `optimization-example.js` - Comparison of inefficient vs. optimized implementations

## How to Run

You can run any of the example scripts using Node.js:

```bash
# Basic examples of complexity classes
node complexity-examples.js

# Run performance measurements
node run-examples.js

# Compare optimized vs unoptimized solutions
node optimization-example.js
```

## What You'll Learn

- How different algorithms perform with varying input sizes
- The practical difference between O(n), O(n²), O(log n) implementations
- How to measure and visualize algorithm performance
- Optimization techniques to improve efficiency

## Recommended Approach

1. Study the code in `complexity-examples.js` to understand the implementation of different complexity classes
2. Run the examples with `run-examples.js` to see how execution time scales with input size
3. Analyze the optimization examples to see how to improve inefficient algorithms
