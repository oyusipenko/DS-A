GRAPH ALGORITHMS PATTERNS

Concept:
Graph algorithms solve problems related to graph data structures, which consist of vertices (nodes) 
and edges connecting these vertices. They're fundamental for solving network-related problems and 
various optimization challenges.

Common Graph Representations:
1. Adjacency Matrix: 2D array where matrix[i][j] indicates edge between i and j
2. Adjacency List: Array of lists where list[i] contains all vertices adjacent to i

Key Graph Algorithms:

1. TRAVERSAL ALGORITHMS
   - Breadth-First Search (BFS): Explore all neighbors at current depth before moving to next depth
   - Depth-First Search (DFS): Explore as far as possible along a branch before backtracking

2. SHORTEST PATH ALGORITHMS
   - Dijkstra's Algorithm: Find shortest path from source to all vertices (non-negative weights)
   - Bellman-Ford: Find shortest path with negative weights (and detect negative cycles)
   - Floyd-Warshall: Find shortest paths between all pairs of vertices

3. MINIMUM SPANNING TREE ALGORITHMS
   - Kruskal's Algorithm: Sort edges by weight and add if no cycle is formed
   - Prim's Algorithm: Grow tree from a starting vertex by adding lowest-weight edge

4. TOPOLOGICAL SORTING
   - Used for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to order vertices such that for every edge u->v, u comes before v

Time Complexity: Varies based on algorithm and implementation, from O(V+E) to O(VÂ³)
Space Complexity: Usually O(V) or O(E) where V is vertices and E is edges

Example 1: Breadth-First Search (BFS)

    result.push(current);

    // Add all unvisited neighbors to queue
    for (const neighbor of graph[current]) {
      if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
        visited.add(neighbor);
        queue.push(neighbor);
      }
    }
  }

        distances[neighbor] = distance;
        previous[neighbor] = minVertex;
      }

    temp.add(node);

    // Visit all neighbors
    for (const neighbor of graph[node]) {
      if (!dfs(neighbor)) return false;
    }

    // Remove from temp and add to visited
    temp.delete(node);
    visited.add(node);

    // Add to result (prepend as we're working backwards)

When to Use:
- BFS: When finding shortest path in unweighted graphs, level-order traversal
- DFS: When exploring all possible paths, cycle detection, connected components
- Dijkstra's: When finding shortest path with non-negative weights
- Bellman-Ford: When finding shortest path with possible negative weights
- Topological Sort: When ordering tasks with dependencies (DAG)
- MST Algorithms: When connecting all vertices with minimum total edge weight
