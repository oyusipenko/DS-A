## Overview

This section covers optimization techniques for system design in web applications, focusing on architectural patterns, distributed systems, and performance monitoring.

## Topics Covered

### [Architectural Patterns](./microservices-vs-monolith.md)
- Microservices vs. monoliths performance trade-offs
- Event-driven architecture optimization
- Serverless computing efficiency considerations
- Service mesh implementation strategies

### [Distributed Systems](./distributed-systems.md)
- CAP theorem and practical implications
- Data consistency models and performance
- Distributed caching strategies
- Message queue patterns and optimization

### [Load Balancing](./load-balancing.md)
- Algorithm selection and configuration
- Session persistence strategies
- Health check optimization
- Geographic load balancing

### [Scaling Strategies](./scaling-strategies.md)
- Horizontal vs. vertical scaling considerations
- Autoscaling triggers and thresholds
- Database sharding techniques
- Read/write splitting patterns

### Performance Monitoring
- Key metrics selection and instrumentation
- Distributed tracing implementation
- Anomaly detection strategies
- Real-time performance dashboards

## Implementation Examples

This directory contains multiple practical examples with both naive and optimized implementations, clearly showing performance differences in typical system design scenarios.

## Related Concepts

These optimizations build upon the foundations covered in:
- Big O Notation (Phase 0)
- Queue (Phase 1)
- Hash Maps & Sets (Phase 1)
- Graph Algorithms (Phase 3)
