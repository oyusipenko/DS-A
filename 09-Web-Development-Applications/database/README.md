## Overview

This section covers optimization techniques for database operations in web applications, focusing on query performance, indexing strategies, and data modeling.

## Topics Covered

### Query Optimization
- Efficient SQL/NoSQL query patterns
- Avoiding common query anti-patterns
- Query plan analysis and optimization
- The n+1 query problem and solutions

### Indexing Strategies
- Index types and use cases
- Index selection and optimization
- Composite indexes
- Index maintenance and overhead considerations

### Join Operations
- Optimizing table joins
- Performance implications of different join types
- When to denormalize vs. using joins
- Handling large join operations

### Data Modeling Choices
- Normalization vs. denormalization trade-offs
- Schema design for specific query patterns
- Document vs. relational data modeling
- Time-series data optimization

### Transaction Management
- Transaction isolation levels and performance
- Optimistic vs. pessimistic locking
- Deadlock prevention
- Batch operations

## Implementation Examples

This directory contains multiple practical examples with both naive and optimized implementations, clearly showing performance differences in typical database operations.

## Related Concepts

These optimizations build upon the foundations covered in:
- Big O Notation (Phase 0)
- Arrays & Hash Maps (Phase 1)
- Sorting & Searching (Phase 1)
