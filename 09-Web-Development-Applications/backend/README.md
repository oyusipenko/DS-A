## Overview

This section covers optimization techniques for backend web development, focusing on server-side performance, middleware design, and API implementation.

## Topics Covered

### [API Endpoint Optimization](./api-optimization.md)
- Response time optimization strategies
- Request validation and sanitization
- Error handling patterns and their performance implications

### [Middleware Design](./middleware-design.md)
- Efficient request processing pipelines
- Authentication and authorization optimizations
- Logging and monitoring with minimal overhead

### [Caching Strategies](./caching-strategies.md)
- Memory-based caching (Redis, Memcached)
- Content caching patterns and invalidation strategies
- Database query caching techniques

### [Background Processing](./background-processing.md)
- Job queue implementations and optimizations
- Worker pools and thread management
- Scheduled task optimization

### [Server Scaling Patterns](./server-scaling-patterns.md)
- Horizontal vs. vertical scaling considerations
- Stateless design for improved scalability
- Load balancing algorithms

## Implementation Examples

This directory contains multiple practical examples with both naive and optimized implementations, clearly showing performance differences in typical backend scenarios.

## Related Concepts

These optimizations build upon the foundations covered in:
- Big O Notation (Phase 0)
- Arrays & Strings (Phase 1)
- Hash Maps & Sets (Phase 1)
- Queue (Phase 1)
