## Learning Approach

### Understanding Key Concepts

**Data Structures** are ways to organize and store data:
- Arrays, linked lists, trees, etc.
- Each has specific performance characteristics
- Different structures excel at different operations

**Algorithms** are step-by-step procedures to solve specific problems:
- Sorting, searching, traversal, etc.
- Each has a specific implementation and complexity
- Can often be optimized for particular use cases

**Patterns** are reusable approaches for solving classes of problems:
- Two pointers, sliding window, divide and conquer, etc.
- Help recognize similarities between problems
- Provide templates for solving new problems

### Learning Recommendations

1. **Follow the Phases**: Progress through phases in order to build knowledge systematically
2. **Practice Consistently**: Aim for daily practice with at least 1-2 problems
3. **Analyze Everything**: Always evaluate the time and space complexity of your solutions
4. **Verbalize Your Process**: Practice explaining your approach aloud
5. **Connect to Web Development**: Relate concepts to familiar web development scenarios
6. **Build Projects**: Implement data structures in real-world web applications

## Getting Started

Begin with [Phase 0: Big O Notation](./01-Big-O-Notation/README.md) and work through each topic sequentially. Each folder contains a README.md with detailed instructions on how to approach that specific topic.

After completing Phases 0 and 1, you'll have a solid foundation for most web development interviews. Phase 2 will help you apply this knowledge and prepare specifically for interviews. Phase 3 covers advanced topics for more competitive positions or specialized roles.
